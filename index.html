      <p>
        Hi, I'm <span><i>Md. Rezwanur Rahman.</i></span> I have completed a BSc
        in Mechatronic Engineering. Now, I am shifting my focus to freelancing
        and starting work in the marketplace. To achieve this, I am learning
        Shopify theme customization and development on Shikbe Shobai. I am
        excited and hope to use these new skills to help businesses create
        attractive and functional online stores. My technical background gives
        me a strong foundation for understanding complex systems, which I
        believe will be valuable in web development. I'm excited about this new
        path and look forward to the opportunities it will bring.
      </p>
